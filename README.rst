Very quick how-to
=================

Currently only Linux is officially supported, but Windows support should be possible with a few minor modifications.

Package building
----------------

* For building native *Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint* packages, the repository has a 'debian' subdirectory with a build description. There is also an **unofficial** PPA at https://launchpad.net/~adrian-arroyocalle/+archive/freerct, set up by Adri√°n Arroyo Calle.

Check out
---------

The source code is in Subversion, so you need a svn client to get it.

The command to do this is

::

        $ svn checkout http://freerct.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/  freerct-read-only

(see also the 'source' tab of the project)

There is also a git mirror of the project on github.

The command to get this is

::

        $ git clone https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT.git

Building the program
--------------------

Almost everything is written in C++, which means you need *g++* or *clang++* to compile it. FreeRCT uses C++11 features, so g++ 4.8+ or clang 3.3+ is recommended.
In addition, you need:

* *lex/flex* - Scanner generator for generating RCD input files. (optional)
* *yacc/bison* - Parser generator for generating RCD input files. (optional)
* *libpng* - Making the RCD data files that contain the graphics and other data read by the program.
* *SDL2* & *SDL2-ttf* - Displaying graphics of the program. Note that SDL2 versions of both libraries are needed.
* *CMake* & *make* - Building the program.

The existence of these programs/libraries is checked by ``cmake``.

Building is as simple as

::

        $ cd freerct-read-only # Go into the downloaded source directory.
        $ cmake .              # Checks libraries are where they're supposed to be and replaces some strings
        $ make                 # Let make do the heavy work.


-  **src** directory contains the source code of the FreeRCT program itself.
-  **src/rcdgen** directory contains the source code of the *rcdgen* program, that builds RCD files from source (which are read by *freerct*).
- **graphics/rcd** directory contains the source files of the RCD data files, except the graphics.
- **graphics/sprites** directory contains all the graphics of the game.
- **bin** directory contains the actual *freerct* executable along with some other files required to actually run the program.

The *cmake/make* commands above will generate the *rcdgen* program, the rcd files and build the 'freerct' program in the src directory.

Config file
-----------

Finally, you need a 'freerct.cfg' INI format file next to the 'freerct' program in the **bin** directory, containing the path to the font file you want to use. It looks like

::

        [font]
        medium-size = 12
        medium-path = /usr/share/fonts/gnu-free/FreeSans.ttf

This means the medium sized font is 12 points high, and its source font definition file is at the indicated path. Make sure you use a path that actually exists.

The actual file is not that critical, as long as it contains the ASCII characters, in the font-size you mention in the file.

Running the program
-------------------

Now run the program

::

        $ cd bin
        $ ./freerct

or

::

        $ make run

which should open a window containing a piece of greenly coloured flat world, and a toolbar near the left top (see also the pictures in the blog).

Pressing 'q' quits the program.
