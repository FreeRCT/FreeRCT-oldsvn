FreeRCT manual
==============

While the game is still in development (and not much of a game currently),
this is its manual. Its main purpose is to explain the user interface.

When the program is started, you are presented the main game display.
Here you can do the following things:

- Drag the world by holding the right mouse button and moving the mouse.
- Rotate left/right with the cursor left/right buttons at the keyboard.
- Mouse wheel up/down performs smooth terraforming.
- Quit the program by entering 'q' at the keyboard.


Path building
-------------

A path can be build by opening the path gui. Click 'Paths' in the toolbar. A
window appears with the following buttons:

- Slope buttons 'Down', 'Level', 'Up' to indicate in which vertical
  direction to build the path. (Should be replaced with graphics.)
- Four direction arrows to indicate the horizontal direction of the path.
- 'Forward' and 'Backward' to move the selected tile in the selected
  horizontal direction.
- 'Long' to build a long path in one go.
  Place the tile cursor, then click 'Long'. A path will be constructed to the
  position of the mouse. Click to fixate the position. Then click 'Buy' to
  buy the new path.
- 'Buy' to build a path next to the currently selected tile, in the indicated
  directions (both horizontal and vertical). The currently selected tile will
  move to the newly bought path.
- 'Remove' to sell the currently selected path. Selection will move one tile
  back.

Dragging the world with the right mouse button, and rotating the world
continues to work to allow moving around.
