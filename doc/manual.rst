FreeRCT manual
==============

While the game is still in development (and not much of a game currently),
this is its manual. Its main purpose is to explain the user interface.

When the program is started, you are presented the main game display.
Here you can do the following things:

- Drag the world by holding the right mouse button and moving the mouse.
- Rotate left/right with the cursor left/right buttons at the keyboard.
- Mouse wheel up/down performs smooth terraforming.
- Quit the program by entering 'q' at the keyboard.
